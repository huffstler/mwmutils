# Microsoft Window Manager Utilities
## a.k.a mwmutils  
### Go [here](https://github.com/huffstler/mwmutils/wiki) for information on installation, getting started and more

mwmutils' core is a set of tools for window manipulation in a Microsoft environment. Each tool only has one purpose, to make it as flexible and reliable as possible.

The project has just started, and I need to actually learn how to Rust so it will take some time for the project to get off the ground.

Any and all help is appreciated

Features / Windows Limitations: Yes means it will be included in mwmUtils. Maybe means it will be included if its needed, No means it won't be included (obviously)
