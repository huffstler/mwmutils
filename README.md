# mwmutils  
###Go [here](https://github.com/huffstler/mwmutils/wiki) for information on installation, getting started and more
mwmutils' core is a set of tools for window manipulation in a Microsoft environment. Each tool only has one purpose, to make it as flexible and reliable as possible.

The project has just started, and I need to actually learn how to ahk so it will take some time for the project to get off the ground.

Any and all help is appreciated
